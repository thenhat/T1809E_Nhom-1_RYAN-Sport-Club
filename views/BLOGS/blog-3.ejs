                            <p> Baron Nashor is a voidborn creature residing on Summoner's Rift. This one of a kind creature
                                has a shape and behavior of a river serpent. What differentiates it from a regular serpent
                                is its numerous arachnid appendages, as well as two additional mouths protruding from its
                                head area. The creature has 12 eyes (some of them injured due to past battles), a mouth with
                                sharp teeth that can gape open wide for larger prey, and horned like crests on the top of
                                the head. The colours of the creatures exoskeleton go from dark purple to light teal. This
                                creature was believed to be deceased for numereous centuries, but due to rescent Void rifts
                                opening on Summoner's Rift it has reemerged again.

            <p>Baron Nashor always prioritizes to attack the nearest target, this target usually suffers from 50% damage
                reduction effect. This worm is always very gentle, if no one attacks it, it will just watch the world in
                turmoil. When receiving damage, regardless of who it is, Baron will get angry and attack the nearest man</p>
            <img class="style-100" src="thumbnail/tap-tinh-baron.jpg">
            <p class="mt-3">This explains many very silly questions of players:

                "Why didn't I attack Baron and it hit me?"

                Answer: "You own Fire Armor, it deals damage to Baron".

                "Why did I Move Ancient to the Baron cave and it hit me?"

                Answer: "Ezreal's Ancient Moves has the effect of damaging."

                Â 

                Before the targets were flung up into the sky by the Poisoning Spell, a layer of green effervescent liquid
                would appear at their feet for two seconds. So players can actively avoid this move. If you watch the video
                of gamers online, you will find that when they solo with Baron, they do not stand still and move, move
                constantly.</p>

            <img class="style-100" src="thumbnail/AN-BARON.jpg">
            <p class="mt-3">In big matches, gamers are always sure to play and most teams always eat Baron at the end of the
                game. There are also cases of Baron being killed right from the start. Depending on the game, you can finish
                Baron at different times.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>When you want to eat Baron, you and your teammates need to make sure 2 things: your team must have a complete
                vision to defend when the enemy comes to harass; You must make sure the enemy has no view in the Baron cave
                area and around.</p>

            <div class="text-danger mb-3 mt-3 lol-text-contain">The appropriate time for the team to host Baron is:</div>
            <div class="mt-3">- Your team cleans the enemy and all still have plenty of blood, lots of moves. However, you need to consider: eating Baron or breaking pillars, give yourself quick and accurate decisions.</div>
            <div class="mt-3">- The main damage and the enemy's forest walker died. However, the other members of the enemy will definitely try to harass you. You and the team need to make the right decision for this case.</div>
            <div class="mt-3">- The enemy lineup is too low, must return home.</div>
            <div class="mt-3">- When the enemy does not have the necessary sight, the team can also come and finish Baron. This needs to be done quickly to prevent the opponent from realizing it.</div>
